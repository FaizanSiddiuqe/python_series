## In the python we have only two loops
#1. for loop
#2. While loop

### In the for loop we use range keyword which is built function of the python which defined the width of the for loop
### when we use range here in it same concept like another language like c++ etc
### loop will start from zero if we don't initialize it  and would go to range-1
### SYNTAX

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

## print the my name three times

for name in range(3):
    print("Faizan Siddique")

## while loop 
## its similar to another language while loop
#here is the example
###SYNTAX

i = 1
while(i <= 3):
    print(i)
    i +=1
